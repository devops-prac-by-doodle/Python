# Tuple

Just like Lists, Tuple is also used to store multiple items in a variable.

## Differences between Tuple and List

| Tuple      | List |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Tuple is Immutable      | List is Mutable       |
| Tuple is more appropriate for accessing data      | List is more appropriate for performing insertion, updating and deletion|
| Tuple consumes **Less** memory compared to Lists   | Lists consume **more** memory compared to Tuple|
| Operations on Tuple is **Less** time consuming   | List operations are time consuming|
| Preferred over Lists to store Heterogenous items   | Preferred over Tuple to store Homogeneous items|
| Supports less in-built functions   | Supports many in-built functions|
| Initialized using ()   | Initialized using []|

## Similarities between Tuple and List

* Both of them are in-built data types.
* Both of them are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
* Both of them can hold duplicate items.
* Both List and Tuple items can be accessed using their index.

## In-built methods

Python supports below in-built methods for Tuples.

1. count()
2. index()

### count()

count method is used to identify the number of times an item occurs in a tuple.

### index()

index method is used to retrieve the index of a specific item in a list. If the specific item is present multiple times in a list, index method returns the index of first match.
