# Introduction

Arithmetic and Logical operations are basic building blocks of any programming language. Let's deep dive into the different operations that Python supports on Variables.

1. `Arithmetic` Operations

2. `Assignment` Operations

3. `Relational` Operations

4. `Logical` Operations

5. `Identity` Operations

6. `Membership` Operations

7. `Bitwise` Operations

8. `Precedence` of Operations

Identity Operators and Membership Operators are sometimes referenced together as Special Operators. However it is important to understand the necessity and usage of each Operator rather than what they are referred to.
