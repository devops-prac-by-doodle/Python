# Precedence of Operators

Precedence of operators is used by the python interpreter to determine the output of an expression.

Python follows the below order of precedence on operators.

* Parentheses
* Exponentiation
* Multiplication and Division
* Addition and Subtraction
  
**Note:** Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left-to-right.

## Try by yourself

Guess the output of below expressions?

`19 - 12 * 2`

`61 - 12 + 12`

`61 - (12 + 12)`
