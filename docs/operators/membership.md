# Membership Operators

`in`, `not in` are the Membership Operators supported by Python. Membership Operators are used with sequence data types.

Below program implements all the different types of Membership Operations one can use in Python.

```python
rainbow = ["violet", "indigo", "blue", "green", "yellow", "orange", "red"]
naturalNum = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
name = "Abhishek"

print("blue" in rainbow)
print(0 in naturalNum)
print("A" in name)
print("a" in name)
```

Output:

```txt
True
False
True
False
```
